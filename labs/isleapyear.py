Description

Write a method for determining if a year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
The system is to check if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible
by 400.

For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.
Write a function that takes in a year as input and returns True if the year is a leap
year, return False otherwise.

Note: background on leap year https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year

The name of the method should be isleapyear and the method should take one parameter which is the year to test.  Here is an example call to the function

mybirthyear = 2000 

If isleapyear(mybirthyear):

    print(“Year {0} was a leap year”.format(mybirthyear))

There are five tests each worth 2 points

Note: You do not need any other code including the main method or any print statements. ONLY the isleapyear method is required. Otherwise, the autograder will fail and be unable to grade your code. (I.e., do not include the above example in your code.) The above example should be used be test your code but deleted or comment out upon submission.
