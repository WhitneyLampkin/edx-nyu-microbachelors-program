# Lecture 2: Hello World

## General Notes
- "In computer science we design algorithms to solve computational problems. We then implement them in a formal programming language which would be executed by a computer."
	- Algorithms - 
	- Computational problems - the statement of the problem
		- Define set of legal inputs
		- Define the required output for each input
		- Ex. The Sorting Problem
			- Input: A sequence of numbers <a1, a2, ..., an>
				- Output: A reordering <b1, b2, ...,bn> such that <b1 <= b2 <= ... <= bn>
	- Programming language - 
	- Executed by a computer -  

## Python
- All inputs from users are strings so conversions are necessary
- Use `#` for line comments and `""""""` for block comments
- Don't use `""` with print() function
